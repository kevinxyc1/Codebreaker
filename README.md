# Codebreaker

Code Breaker is a code breaking game of logic. Your aim is to crack the code with the least attempts possible. 

Rules:
You get 8 attempts at breaking the code. If you can't discover it by then then you lose that game. Then you can get a new code and try again.

The Code Breaker code is made up of 4 colours from the 6 available colours. To win you must place the right marbles in the right order. After each attempt you will be told how you went:

White marble (W) - Means that there is one of your marbles in the code but not in the right place.
Black marble (B) - Means that there is one of your marbles in the code and in the right place.
The answer marbles are not in any particular order and don't line up with your code marbles.
